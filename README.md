# data-bs4


To run this code, follow these steps:

Install the necessary libraries: pandas, beautifulsoup4, and requests. You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas beautifulsoup4 requests
Save the code in a file named el_pais_scraper.py.
```

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved el_pais_scraper.py.

Run the code by typing the following command:


```python el_pais_scraper.py
The code will scrape the headlines and links from the homepage of El País in Mexico and save the data in a CSV file named 'noticias_ElPais_MX.csv'. The file will be created in the same directory as the script.
```

Note: Make sure that you have an active internet connection, as the code sends a GET request to the website to retrieve the data.
